h1. SDMI IFSAR

The 2010 SDMI IFSAR collection overlapped much the SuWa Hydro project.  UAF-GINA is developing a website "ifsar.gina.alaska.edu":http://ifsar.gina.alaska.edu as a data distribution website.

Quick overview for SuWa Hydro folks:

* The official deliverables did not include contours.  The collection was done at an accuracy and density that should cleanly support 22 foot contour lines.
* Public domain
* Informational website: "ifsar.gina.alaska.edu":http://ifsar.gina.alaska.edu
